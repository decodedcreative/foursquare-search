## Installation Process
- Open a Terminal window, 'cd' into this directory and run 'npm install'. This will create a node_modules directory in the root project folder and download gulp and its supporting plugins that have been used during the development of this project.

- Once the previous command has stopped running, in the Terminal run 'gulp'. This will run the Gulp task runner and its associated tasks as outlined in the gulpfile.js file found in the root project folder.

- One of these tasks - Browsersync - will cause a browser to open up on your machine displaying the project.
